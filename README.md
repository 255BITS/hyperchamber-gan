## Changelog

## 0.6 ~ "MultiGAN" - Experimental

### 0.6.x

* new defaults
  * discriminator: use `layer_norm` to help prevent mode collapse
  * discriminator: enable `progressive enhancement`
  * encoder: `encode_periodic_gaussian`
  * generator: `dense_resize_conv`

### 0.6.0

* 3 new encoders
* New discriminator: `densenet` - based loosely on https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993
* Updated discriminator: `pyramid_no_stride` - `conv` and `avg_pool` together
* New generator: `dense_resize_conv` - original type of generator that seems to work well
* Updated generator: `resize_conv` - standard resize-conv generator.  This works much better than `deconv`, which is not supported.
* Several quality of life improvements
* Support for multiple discriminators
* Support for discriminators on different image resolutions

## 0.5 ~ "FaceGAN" - Stable

### 0.5.x final

* fixed configuration save/load
* cleaner cli output
* documentation cleanup

<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/255BITS/HyperGAN/master/doc/face-manifold-0-5-6.png'/>

### 0.5.0
* pip package released!
* Better defaults.  Good variance.  256x256.  The broken images showed up after training for 5 days.

### 0.1-0.4
* Initial private release

<div id="samples"/>


<div id='quickstart'/>

## Quick start

<div id='minreqs'/>

### Minimum requirements

1. For 256x256, we recommend a GTX 1080 or better.  32x32 can be run on lower-end GPUs.
2. CPU mode is _extremely_ slow.  Never train with it!


<div id='qs-install'/>

### Install hypergan


### Installing 0.6(Experimental):

```bash
  pip install hypergan --upgrade
```

### Installing 0.5(Stable)
```bash
  pip install hypergan==0.5.8 --upgrade
```

<div id='qs-train'/>

### Train

```bash
  # Train a 32x32 gan with batch size 32 on a folder of pngs
  hypergan train [folder] -s 32x32x3 -f png -b 32
```

<div id='qs-increase'/>

### Increasing performance

On ubuntu `sudo apt-get install libgoogle-perftools4` and make sure to include this environment variable before training

```bash
  LD_PRELOAD="/usr/lib/libtcmalloc.so.4" hypergan train my_dataset
```

<div id='qs-devmode'/>
### Development mode

If you wish to modify hypergan

```bash
git clone https://github.com/255BITS/hypergan
cd hypergan
python3 setup.py develop
```

<div id='qs-runoncpu'/>
### Running on CPU

Make sure to include the following 2 arguments:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES= hypergan --device '/cpu:0'
```

To build a new network you need a dataset.  Your data should be structured like:

``` 
  [folder]/[directory]/*.png
```

If you don't have a dataset, you can use [http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html).

<div id="createdataset"/>
## Creating a Dataset

<div id='supervised-learning'/>

### Supervised learning

Each directory in your dataset represents a classification.  Using supervised learning mode will turn your `discriminator` into a `classifier`.

<div id='unsupervised-learning'/>

### Unsupervised learning

Same as supervised, except only include 1 directory in your dataset.


# Training

## hypergan train


```bash
  # Train a 256x256 gan with batch size 32 on a folder of pngs
  hypergan train [folder] -s 32x32x3 -f png -b 32 --config [name]
```

Configs and saves are located in:

```bash
  ~/.hypergan/
```

<div id='configuration'/>

# Configuration

Configuration in HyperGAN uses JSON files.  You can create a new config by running `hypergan train`.  By default, configurations are randomly generated using [Hyperchamber](https://github.com/255BITS/hyperchamber).


<div id='configuration-usage'/>

## Usage

```bash
  --config [name]
```

Naming a configuration during training is recommended.  If your config is not named, a uuid will be used.

# Building

## hypergan build

Build takes the same arguments as train and builds a generator.  It's required for serve.

Building does 2 things:

* Loads the training model, which include the discriminator
* Saves into a ckpt model containing only the generator

# Server mode

## hypergan serve

Serve starts a flask server.  You can then access:

[http://localhost:5000/sample.png?type=batch](http://localhost:5000/sample.png?type=batch)

## Saves

Saves are stored in `~/.hypergan/saves/`

They can be large.

## Formats

```bash
--format <type>
```

Type can be one of:
* jpg
* png

## Arguments

To see a detailed list, run 
```bash
  hypergan -h
```

* -s, --size, optional(default 64x64x3), the size of your data in the form 'width'x'height'x'channels'
* -f, --format, optional(default png), file format of the images.  Only supports jpg and png for now.


## Discriminators

The discriminators job is to tell if a piece of data is real or fake.  In hypergan, a discriminator can also be a classifier.

You can combine multiple discriminators in a single GAN. 

### pyramid_stride

### pyramid_nostride


Progressive enhancement is enabled by default:

<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/255BITS/HyperGAN/master/doc/progressive-enhancement.png'/>

Default.

### densenet

Progressive enhancement is enabled by default here too.

### resnet

Note: This is currently broken 

## Encoders

### Vae

For Vae-GANs

### RandomCombo

Default

### RandomNormal

## Generators

### resize-conv

Standard resize-conv.

### dense-resize-conv

Default.  Inspired by densenet.

## Trainers

### Adam

Default.

### Slowdown

Experimental.

# Debugging a generator

## Visualizing learning

One way a network learns:

[![Demo CountPages alpha](https://j.gifs.com/58KmzA.gif)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj3ZLNfcJFo&list=PLWW3WtkBA3MuSnAVS__D0FkENZzuTbHFg&index=1)

To create your own visualizations, you can use the flag:

```bash
  --frame_sample grid 
```

To turn these images into a video:

```bash
  ffmpeg -i samples/grid-%06d.png -vcodec libx264 -crf 22 -threads 0 gan.mp4
```

NOTE: z_dims must equal 2 and batch size must equal 32 to work.

# About

Generative Adversarial Networks(2) consist of (at least) two neural networks that learn together over many epochs.
The discriminator learns the difference between real and fake data.  The generator learns to create fake data.

For a more in-depth introduction, see here [http://blog.aylien.com/introduction-generative-adversarial-networks-code-tensorflow/](http://blog.aylien.com/introduction-generative-adversarial-networks-code-tensorflow/)

A single fully trained `GAN` consists of the following useful networks:

* `generator` - Generates content that fools the `discriminator`.
* `discriminator` - Gives a value between 0 and 1 designating how `real` the input data is.
* `classifier` - Only available with supervised learning mode.  Classifies an image by type.  Some examples of possible datasets are 'apple/orange', 'cat/dog/squirrel'.  See <a href='#createdataset'>Creating a Dataset</a>.

HyperGAN is currently in open beta.
